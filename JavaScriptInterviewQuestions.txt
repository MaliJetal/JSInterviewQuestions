Q1] What is Javascript?
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. 
JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
Q2]. Features in JS
- Light-weight- javascripts compiler engine is very complicated and makes JS works faster.
- Interpreted- it is interpretednot a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. More modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
- object-oriented
- prototype-based multi-paradigm scripting laguage
Q3]. Different types of functions?
- Named -Anonymous
Q4]. Closure
In JavaScript, we need closures when a variable which is defined outside the scope in reference is accessed from some inner scope.
Q5]. What is BOM?
BOM stands for Browser Object Model. It provides interaction with the browser. The default object of a browser is a window. So, you can call all the functions of the window by specifying the window or directly. The window object provides various properties like document, history, screen, navigator, location, innerHeight, innerWidth,
Q6]. What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. A document object represents the HTML document. It can be used to access and change the content of HTML.
The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
Q7]. What is the use of window object?
The window object is created automatically by the browser that represents a window of a browser. It is not an object of JavaScript. It is a browser object.
alert() confirm() prompt() open() close() setTimeout()
Q8]. What is the use of history object?
The history object of a browser can be used to switch to history pages such as back and forward from the current page or another page. There are three methods of history object.
history.back() history.forward() history.go(number)
Q9]. Javascript Hositing?
In simple words, we can say that we can use the variables and functions in JavaScript before declaring them because as we discussed above JavaScript compiler moves the declarations of all the variables and functions at the top of their scope so that there will not be an error of any kind. The concept of JavaScript of moving all declarations of the variables and functions to the top of their scope by compiler itself just before the execution of code is known as Hoisting.
1. Declaration -> 2.Initialisation/Assignment ->3. Usage
Q10]. How to create objects in JavaScript?
There are 3 ways to create an object in JavaScript.
By object literal
By creating an instance of Object
By Object Constructor
Q11]. How to create an array in JavaScript?
There are 3 ways to create an array in JavaScript.
By array literal
By creating an instance of Array
By using an Array constructor
Q12]. What does the isNaN() function?
The isNan() function returns true if the variable value is not a number. 
Q13]. Difference between Client side JavaScript and Server side JavaScript?
Client-side JavaScript comprises the basic language and predefined objects which are relevant to running JavaScript in a browser. The client-side JavaScript is embedded directly by in the HTML pages. The browser interprets this script at runtime.
Server-side JavaScript also resembles client-side JavaScript. It has a relevant JavaScript which is to run in a server. The server-side JavaScript are deployed only after compilation.
Q14].  In which location cookies are stored on the hard disk?
The storage of cookies on the hard disk depends on the OS and the browser.
The Netscape Navigator on Windows uses a cookies.txt file that contains all the cookies. The path is c:\Program Files\Netscape\Users\username\cookies.txt
The Internet Explorer stores the cookies on a file username@website.txt. The path is: c:\Windows\Cookies\username@Website.txt.
Q15]. What is difference between null and undefined
Undefined value: A value that is not defined and has no keyword is known as undefined value. For example:
int number;//Here, a number has an undefined value.  
Null value: A value that is explicitly specified by the keyword "null" is known as a null value. For example:
String str=null;//Here, str has a null value.  
Q16]. What is the difference between View state and Session state?
"View state" is specific to a page in a session whereas "Session state" is specific to a user or browser that can be accessed across all pages in the web application.
Q17]. What is the use of a TypedArray object in JavaScript?
The JavaScript TypedArray object illustrates an array like a view of an underlying binary data buffer. There is any number of different global properties, whose values are TypedArray constructors for specific element types.

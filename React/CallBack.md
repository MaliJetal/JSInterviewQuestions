### CallBack Hell
-This is a big issue caused by coding with complex nested callbacks. Here, each and every callback takes an argument that is a result of the previous callbacks. 
-In this manner, The code structure looks like a pyramid, making it difficult to read and maintain.

####  What we should do to get rid of hell?
-JavaScript provides an easy way of escaping from a callback hell. This is done by event queue and promises.
A <b>promise</b> is a returned object from any asynchronous function, to which callback methods can be added based on the previous functionâ€™s result.
Promises use .then() method to call async callbacks. We can chain as many callbacks as we want and the order is also strictly maintained.
